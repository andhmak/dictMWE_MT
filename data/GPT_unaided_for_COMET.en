"Verikios was there, he had shown his claws and said that “I want Kainourgiou too somewhere” and now he remains in the cold of the bath because Moutsinas has gone", said Giorgos Bezas.   Note: The translation may not make much sense because it seems to be part of a larger conversation or context, specifically referring to certain individuals - "Verikios", "Kainourgiou" and "Moutsinas" are all names of people. "Giorgos Bezas" is the one who is speaking in the quoted text.

Please note that there could be certain colloquial expressions or specific cultural references that may not have been properly translated due to the lack of context. 
"Valencia knocked out Barcelona's ... livers at the championship semifinals, played excellent basketball, and lost a great qualification in the details."   The translation provided is a literate one and contains the phrase "knocked out Barcelona's livers" which doesn't make much sense in English. Greek expressions don't always translate perfectly into English, and this could be an insider reference or metaphor in Greek sports commentary. A more clear translation could be, "Valencia ousted Barcelona in the championship semifinals, played excellent basketball, but lost out on major qualification due to minor details."

Literally, it means "he took out our livers", a common Greek phrase similar to the English "he's a pain in the neck".  
"Come on, damn it, 2 units left to see what will happen . It brought us here to our wits' end."

This text appears to be a mixture of Greek and what appears to be random English and French words/phrases. The Greek parts can be translated, but the mixture of languages and idiosyncratic expression makes the entire translation nonsensical in English. The Greek section can be loosely translated as:  “The Prime Minister, a characteristic symptom of the Greek race, lest we get a gallon, a sardine, a small trophy and the straw is well-mounted."  This is a literal translation and does not make much sense. If there is specific context to this quote, it might help in providing a more accurate translation.

"The likes of the Kasimates, the Bampides, the Portosaltes, and the other loudmouths of thug-journalism, who brazenly tried to convince us that Michaloliakos' gang is a legitimate political party."   It's important to highlight that the names mentioned in the Greek phrase are probably persons involved in or associated with media/journalism in Greece and that the context of the sentence regarding Michaloliakos likely references Greek politics. Moreover, the phrase utilizes sarcasm and colloquial expressions which might not have an exact translation across languages. So, this translation provides the general sentiment intended by the speaker.

The given Greek text doesn't seem to be grammatically correct or a complete sentence, which makes it hard to translate clearly. If we go only by direct translation of individual words, it might be approximate to something like "YES, THERE TO THE AIGLE...AND OF THE PAN WITH 'ADULTERATED' DRINKS..." in English. But this doesn't form a coherent sentence in English due to lack of context and correct grammar. It may also be a greatly informal phrase or might contain slang, idiomatic expressions or other regional variations. 
"One of them, on the eve of the operation that was supposed to send him to Paradise, went to a bar where, after drinking alcohol (which, according to Islamic law, automatically excludes him from Paradise), he beat up the bartender over a discrepancy in the bill of a few dollars, risking getting caught by the sheriff and blowing up the largest terrorist operation of all time."

Please note that "περίδρομο" (peridromo) and "σκνίπα" (sknipa) are slang terms with no exact translation in English; they are colloquial and context-specific.

This sentence seems not to make sense in Greek. "Αυτό το κορίτσι είναι πολύ μη μου άπτου." could be roughly translated as "This girl is very not touch me" which clearly doesn't make sense in English, so it's likely there is a mistake in the Greek text.

The phrase "there is no saliva" might also be a way to express disbelief or shock at someone's audacity or actions.

Please note that translations, especially for slang or idiomatic phrases, can vary significantly based on context.

The direct translation would be somewhat like "I specifically lit (the) fuses (of) Megki, it didn't bother me at all..." However, without any more context, it might not make sense and could be subject to different interpretations. (Megki is not a known Greek word or name; it could be a name, a place or something else within the context.)

"Become with the small suitcase with the codes that can affect the whole planet Earth Madiam." 
"They will make Macedonia Palas of his own land, Midian, while the event turns against the Prespa agreement.."   This translation might seem nonsensical as the original text seems to have errors possibly due to incorrect grammar or context. Especially, the context of "Macedonia Palas" and "Midian" is unclear. Palas could be spelled as "Pallas", the titan god from Greek mythology, while Midian refers to a geographical area and its people from the Hebrew Bible. Because of these, the text may be a symbolic or metaphorical reference needing further contextual clarification to make a correct translation.

This sentence seems to be in Cypriot Greek dialect and may not make complete sense directly translated to English as it might contain local slang words. From how I understand it, it is supposed to mean that Alexandra is being formal or reserved, not being sociable, friendly or chummy. 
"There are moments when we can't make heads or tails.."

The Greek sentence "Αν αγαπιέςτε έρχεστε εις γάμου κοινωνία." does not make sense in Greek. Its word-to-word translation would be something like "If you love, you come to wedding fellowship." However, that doesn't reflect a meaningful sentence in Greek or in English. Please provide the correct Greek text for accurate translation.

This phrase features repetition for emphasis and it is full of colloquial and idiomatic expressions. A literal translation might not express the intended meaning, as this seems to involve figurative language. However, generally, these words could translate as "I have him up up, sit sit." To give you a better translation, I would need more context to understand who is speaking, to whom, and about what or whom. The idiomatic and colloquial nature of the phrase make it difficult to translate accurately without context. 
"And let's not forget that a cat is not a dog to have it up-up...sit, sit." This sentence seems to point out the difference between cats and dogs, specifically in their training or behavior. One possible interpretation could be that you shouldn't force or expect a cat to behave like a dog, or follow commands like "up" or "sit". 
"Tsipras wants Kammenos because he has him up-down, sit-sit." 
The exact translation would be "Your concern and I will have it in the Parliament. Get up, get up, sit down, sit down!" However, this phrase may be an idiomatic expression or part of a song's lyrics and its meaning may vary based on the context. 
"Stand up - stand up, sit down - sit down, it seems his wife has him under her thumb." 
"What can one expect from someone who has an IQ of a radish?" 
"But they justify themselves, since they have radish roots!!!" 
"They probably have a political IQ, ai-kiou, radish."   Note: The Greek phrase contains elements of humor and wordplay that may not directly translate into English. The terms "άϊ-κιού" and "ραδικιού" are not standard Greek and seem to be playful distortions or puns. Therefore, the English translation may not fully capture the intended humor or nuance.

"They may have an ace up their sleeve."

The government spoiled the "mayonnaise". 
"I caught the moment when the mayonnaise spoiled and why it spoiled." 
The translation would be: "Definitely, he himself, Kusumbri, who spoiled the mayonnaise, with the book and the elements that he gave, but the kids don't stick with such (here he got the provision of garments, with his own quality of hafije, will he stick with such?)."  Please note that the text seems to include certain colloquial expressions, possibly specific to a certain dialect or region, which may not translate one hundred percent accurately into English. Their meaning might slightly vary in different contexts as well. Also, words like Kusumbri and Hafije don't have a specific translation in English; they seem to be names or unique terms in a certain dialect or sub-language.

The phrase "αρχιζω τα μα μου σου του" in English roughly translates to "I am starting mine, yours, his/hers". However, this does not make much sense in English as a standalone phrase as it lacks context and is quite colloquial.

"A sponsorship by the magazine "Nitro" that this month circulates with Eleonora Meleti posing for the cameras dressed for the first time and informing us that the well-known journalist Antonis Panoutsos furiously left last night." 
"Definitely, if you're going to commit suicide, I suggest through a sex overdose, where you will literally burst the petals, or you may change your mind!"

"You have shaken us to the core, you are cutting off our life breath, you are sending us to financial hell and you talk to us about legal civilization?" 
"However, because a pear tree has its tail at the back, he also had a son after many years that literally shook their petals." 
Unfortunately, the text seems to contain a mixture of Greek and possibly slang or misspelled words, so the whole sentence integrity might not make full sense. Here is a partial translation: "instead of him, the type (of person), the tough one, saw it and [unknown word] and tough guy with the pistol Source: www.lifo.gr". The meaning of the word "καουμπου" is not clear, it could be a slang, a name, or a typo.

"You are funny, really, I want so much to laugh at what you do, put some thought into it for a moment..." 
"Give a little thought to a few things and stop trying to insult me or offend me with your so-called smart remarks."

The phrase "εις των άλλων την καμπούρα πίνω, γίνομαι στουπί" is a Greek idiom that translates to "I drink others' medium vodka, I become a drunkard" in English.   However, it's important to note that idioms typically don't translate well literally into other languages; they're unique expressions with meanings that can diverge significantly from the direct translation of their component words. The literal translation of this Greek idiom doesn't convey its meaning to English speakers. The general idea of this Greek idiom perhaps is about taking on others' troubles or obligations and suffering as a result. Confirmation of this idiomatic meaning from a native Greek speaker could be helpful.

The translation of the Greek text "Τζόυς Ευείδη: «Το θέατρο είναι μπάτε σκύλοι αλέστε»" is not accurate because the phrase "μπάτε σκύλοι αλέστε" is a Greek idiom that doesn't translate directly. In general context, it could possibly mean "Joyce Epeedi: The theater is hard work" indicating that theater requires significant effort similar to dogs grinding or milling. However, the sentence seems to lack coherence in Greek as well.   It is always recommended to get the translation from a certified translator or a native speaker who is familiar with the idioms and expressions of the Greek language.

"Why do I remember that when the New Democracy was the government again, it was like 'let the dogs grind' again." 
The Greek text "Φαντάσου πόσο μπάτε σκύλοι, αλέστε είναι η επιχείρηση." does not make sense in Greek. Are you sure there is no typo in the text? It seems to be a mix of unrelated words and phrases. Could you please provide some context or check the spelling? 
The Greek phrase "αφου ειμαστε "μπατε σκυλοι αλεστε κι αλεστικα μη δινετε"" can be translated to English as "Since we are ‘grind dogs, grind and don't give grist’". This is a Greek idiom, suggesting that one is doing a difficult task without the necessary means or resources, similar to being asked to grind grain but not being provided with the grain.

"We are penniless. There is not a single one. Not even a spit, that's why we don't spit on you. Take from those who stole and don't let them off the hook."   Please note that translating from Greek into English can sometimes be challenging due to idiomatic expressions and cultural context. 'Not even a spit, that's why we don't spit on you' seems to be a Greek idiom, which may not translate well or makes much sense in English. It's used in this context to emphasize the speaker's poverty. 
The literal translation is "The state owes us nothing because it is cloth against cloth." However, this phrase appears to be idiomatic or metaphorical and the exact meaning can depend on the context. It suggests that everyone needs to fend for themselves because the state owes us nothing, with "cloth against cloth" potentially hinting at the struggle for resources or the competitive nature of society. Please consult a Greek speaker for a more precise cultural interpretation because idioms do not always translate directly to other languages and can lose their original meaning.

However, the exact translation would depend on the context and the full sentences where the phrases originate from. This partial sentence suggests that a ten year old boy was fined 80 euros for a violation involving a bicycle, but that fine was ultimately dismissed by senior officers. 
"The policeman hung up the call on the young man, who decided to turn a blind eye." 
"85 euros that I managed to erase though."

"Kostas Kaisaris writes about AEK that went... trouserless to the cucumbers at "Karaiskakis" with Manolo Jimenez forcing it to play the role of the "hare" in Gkimpri Selassie."   Note: This is a literal translation of the text. This sentence could likely include idiomatic phrases, metaphors or cultural references that lose their original meaning when translated to English literally. For example, "trouserless to the cucumbers" or "role of hare" might be Greek idioms with non-literal meanings. "Karaiskakis" is a sports stadium in Greece, "AEK" is a Greek football club, Manolo Jimenez is a Spanish professional football manager and "Gkimpri Selassie" could be a misspelled version of a person’s name but there is a lack of context.

"Olympiakos went stripped to the cucumbers." 
"Wow, these guys are talking about crazy shenanigans. They even lost their underwear in the pickles."   Please note that this is a somewhat colloquial and idiomatic expression and the literal translation may not make perfect sense in English. The expression "ξεβράκωτοι στα αγγούρια" does not translate directly to English, but it is typically used to describe being in a very challenging situation or a big disaster. 
"I cut his gall" is the literal translation. However, this Greek phrase is often used idiomatically to mean "I make him very angry" or "I infuriate him". 
"It cut me to the quick"

"They cut their gall!" 
"You simply cut our bile a little" is the literal translation, but its idiomatic meaning is "You simply annoyed or irritated us a little". This phrase is used in Greek to express annoyance or frustration.

"Sotiris Duros separated his 'tsanakia' from the self-governing faction of PASOK,"  The term "τσανάκια" (tsanakia) is a bit difficult to translate because it is a colloquial term which doesn't have a direct English equivalent. Generally, it refers to a group of people that someone is in charge of or looks after. In this context, it could refer to his team or his group. The name "ΠΑΣΟΚ" refers to the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, a political party in Greece.

"Their cups were split and Angelina Jolie with Brad Pitt." The sentence doesn't make perfect sense since it is lacking some context. 'Τα τσανάκια τους χώρισαν' is a Greek idiom meaning 'they've split' where 'τσανάκια' literally translates into 'cups'. So a more sensible translation could be "They split up, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt". 
"This pair is also gone, their little querrels separated them!"

Their jars separated them ... 
"The defensive midfielder from Volos, who impressed us with his fighting spirit until the end last year, separated his tea cup from the team of Farsala."   NOTE: "Τσανάκι" literally translates to "little tea cup", but it is often used in a metaphorical sense to imply a strong connection or attachment to something. Therefore, the phrase "χώρισε το τσανάκι του από την Φαρσαλινή ομάδα" could mean that the player has parted ways or severed ties with the team from Farsala. Also, the cities Volos and Farsala are located in Greece, suggesting that this may be referring to a Greek football player. The correct interpretation would depend on the overall context in which this sentence is being used.

"Guys, I had it rough yesterday, today my eyes are like little birds." This phrase is used in Greek to mean that someone is very tired or has a hangover. The "eyes are like little birds" part means that the person's eyes are half-closed or blinking from tiredness, like a bird's.
