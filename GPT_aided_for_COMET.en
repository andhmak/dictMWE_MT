The expression's literal and figurative interpretations have to be considered for a nuanced translation. Here's my attempt:  "I will wear my hat askew // And hang my jacket on my shoulder // There will come nights of pain and drinking // But I won't lose the journey of my life."  This translation may not capture all the implicit connotations. A more figurative rendering that incorporates the idiomatic sense of "wearing my hat askew" could be:  "I will show indifference // And bear the weight on my shoulder // There will come nights of enduring pain and drowning in liquor // But I won't forfeit the journey of my life."

The Greek text "ή βάζει στραβα το καπέλο και άντε γεια..." translates to English as "or he puts his hat on crooked and goodbye..." As you've pointed out, the phrase "βάζω το καπέλο μου στραβά" is idiomatic in Greek. In this context, it implies an attitude of indifference or dismissal towards someone or something. A more colloquial English interpretation might be: "or he just blows you off and says goodbye...".
"He put on his tiny hat askew yesterday and left." In this case, it sounds like the phrase means the person was indifferent or dismissive and walked out. The specific cultural context of the phrase would need to be considered to grasp the intended nuance better.

"But fortunately, they are suspicious and wary of not only latecomers, but also ambitious 'saviors' like this individual who, with all they have disseminated and continue to recklessly disseminate, bombarding all Greek media with emails, showing who truly is their primary target. Not because they care about you and your personal drama, or about Myrto. He couldn’t care less! But because he has selfish motives and a specific goal."

"I'll negotiate, I won't just go into prostitution like that."
"I work and sometimes I even go out on a limb to supplement"
While maintaining the cultural context, the English translation could be "Go out on the 'branch' of Antenna one more time". Note that 'going out on the branch' refers to the Greek multi-word expression “βγαίνω στο κλαρί” which can mean engaging in an unacceptable profession or behavior. The word 'Antenna' is a Greek TV Radio station. The entire interpretation of the sentence depends heavily on the context in which it is used.
"Kammenos went to the bad" could be a possible translation. Considering the idiomatic expression and its interpretation, it should reflect some descent into a morally disapproved profession or action. The term 'Kammenos' is a proper noun and could be considered a person's name. The given English interpretation nuances can significantly change depending upon the specific context it is used in.

"He is the footstool of his feet:"
"Come, Mother-Father Wisdom, Mistress of Heaven and Earth, come enwrapped by the Sun, you who hold the Moon as the footstool of your feet."
The Greek phrase "έχω υποπόδιο των ποδιών" directly translates to "I have a footstool of the feet" in English. However, based on the context that the phrase is used, it can metaphorically mean "I have someone under my control" or "someone is my stooge".
"By implication, do they take a woman to be under their foot?"
"- Do you mean that his boss has him under his thumb? - Yes, he does."
"So, Greek people, since you don't give a damn about all the crazy, ignorant, supposedly left-wing and internationalist things that deficient and in a way problematic personalities serve you daily, especially anything to do with Hellenism and Greekness of Greece, I straight and bluntly tell you that we are of Hun origin, we endorse and embrace cannibalism as a religion, we speak the Turkish baroque version of the Sanskrit language and we love anything else in this world, provided that it does not have Greece, Greek, Hellenic, Macedonia, Macedonian, Thracian, Epirotic, Thessalian, Sterea Hellas, Peloponnesian, Cretan, Aegean, Ionic, Dodecanesian, Cycladic, Evian, "Sporadic" etc as a first or second component."   NB: This remarkable sentence is extremely complex and filled with cultural, historical, and political references that are hard to translate precisely without more knowledge of the context in which it's employed. The names at the end of the sentence refer to Greek regions and their inhabitants.

"Oh yes, Papandreou, or otherwise known as Mr. 42% who left us holding the bag."

"This shows what it means to enter the field and serve interests." When translated literally, it does not have the same inferred meaning as in Greek language.

"Get out on the beat to make your daily earnings, hustle."   It should be noted that this translation is a bit colloquial. With the context you provided, the phrase may imply sex work, but the literal translation does not categorically express this. "Seat" (καρέκλα) refers to 'work for someone' or 'job' in Greek slang. "-te" at the end is an intensive suffix that means 'a lot' or 'excessively'. The original phrase could be interpreted differently based on context.
"And their daily wage is earned by anyone who buys 50-100 balloons or masks and starts hustling on the streets." In this context, I translated "βγαίνω στην πιάτσα" as "starts hustling on the streets" which has a similar meaning to 'working or operating in public, often in a professional or social manner' and considering the context does not suggest a sexual meaning.
"To be on the game and never say no"
"Go out on the track for a bit so I can see something."

"We're out in the markets, okay we get it, when we get out to prostitute ourselves as well, let us know to change into some underwear."
The English translation of the Greek text "είναι πλέον καιρός τα ιντερνετικά ΜΜΕ να σταματήσουν το copy paste και να βγουν και λίγο στην πιάτσα" is "It's high time for online media to stop copy-pasting and get out there a little bit more". The slang term you pointed out does indeed mean to prostitute oneself, but in this context, it is likely used colloquially to signify becoming more actively engaged or involved.
"It's not bad to go out on the streets." The context given implies this phrase could be referring specifically to engaging in prostitution.
"Finally, the water is flowing into the groove. Works 12.6 million for irrigation infrastructure."

The Greek text "κουμπώνω την πρώτη" translates into English as "I shift to first (gear)."
"But I didn't shift quickly.. that's the issue.. I fully closed the gas, pressed the clutch and shifted the gear."
The second meaning of the lemma is widely known among street racers and speed demons. It refers to the "jamming speed" where ambitious drivers without a clutch, with quick movements, shift to gear with the aim of gaining precious seconds in a race.
"Also, many times when I shift to first gear, I feel a kick on the floor."
According to magnesianews.gr, the unbelievable incident occurred at 12:05 today noon, when the car (Mercedes M series) was parked on Plastira Street. The 81-year-old driver got into the driver’s seat and, possibly due to a handling error, instead of engaging the reverse gear, he shifted to the first gear. As a result, the large vehicle moved forward, mounted the sidewalk with speed, reached the beach, dragged a wooden umbrella and ended up in the sea.

The Greek phrase "δεν του κόβει η κούτρα" can be translated into English as "he is not smart" or "his cutter doesn't cut". But bear in mind that "κόβει η κούτρα" is a slang phrase in Greek, with "κούτρα" meaning "cutter" or "knife", and is not formal language.

This translation may vary depending on the dialect and other underlying contextual nuances.

Note: "πάω στα θυμαράκια" is not exactly translated as "to go west" in modern English. This phrase in English comes from cowboy movies and implies dying or being killed. The Greek phrase's literal meaning is "to go to the little thyme plants" and is a euphemism for dying. So, "Do you want me to kick the bucket..." corresponds more closely to that Greek idiom, in terms of both familiarity and register.

Additionally, "salvation year" is a literal translation of "σωτήριον έτος" and it's used here probably metaphorically, maybe with a sense of irony. Lastly, "αμαρτίαν ουκ έχω" is a phrase from the Greek Orthodox liturgy, meaning "I am without sin". Its usage here seems ironic, indicating that the speaker does not acknowledge any wrongdoing in their predictions or thoughts for 2018.
